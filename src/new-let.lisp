(in-package :new-let)

;;; This code implements a new LET macro with expanded syntax and semantics,
;;; a generalization of LET, LET*, and MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND.  Some examples:
;;;
;;;   (let ((a (foo))
;;;         ((b (bar a))))
;;;     ...)
;;;
;;; This example illustrates that clause nesting depth is used to indicate
;;; ordering of evaluation and binding.  B is bound after A, and its initial
;;; value expression refers to A.
;;;
;;;   (let ((a b c (zot))
;;;         ((d (quux a c))
;;;          ((e f (mumble b d))
;;;           (g (mung a))))
;;;         ((h (frobozz c))
;;;          ((i (xyzzy h))))
;;;         (*print-level* 3))
;;;     ...)
;;;
;;; A, B, and C are bound to the first three values of (ZOT), and in parallel,
;;; *PRINT-LEVEL* is bound to 3; then D and H are bound; then E, F, G, and I
;;; are bound.
;;;
;;; As this example illustrates, all bindings at a given nesting level are
;;; done in parallel, with all bindings at a deeper level following.
;;; 
;;; Since I like to use multiple values, I find this syntax for binding them
;;; very handy, and I think many will agree.  (Those familiar with Dylan
;;; will think that I have borrowed the idea from it, but I wrote the first
;;; version of this macro in 1980.)  The value of using nesting to indicate
;;; sequencing will perhaps be less clear.  The additional flexibility
;;; provided, compared to LET*, is admittedly rarely of importance in terms
;;; of expressing an idea in fewer keystrokes.  Personally, though, I like
;;; being able to indicate clearly the data flow dependences among the
;;; various variables I may be binding in one LET; and I have written LET
;;; expressions of complexity comparable to the second example above.  (I
;;; should emphasize that the breaking up of the clauses into groups, as in
;;; that second example, to emphasize their data dependence relationships
;;; is strictly for clarity; in fact, the initial value expression for G,
;;; for instance, is within the scope of H.)
;;;
;;; This code also implements an extension to COND.  It is simply this: that
;;; if the predicate expression of a COND clause is a LET form, the scope of
;;; all variables bound by the LET is extended to include the consequent
;;; expressions of the clause.  (However, it does not include subsequent
;;; clauses.)  This simplifies the writing of somewhat Prolog-like code that
;;; simultaneously tests that an object has a certain structure and binds
;;; variables to parts of that structure in order to do something else.
;;; (In order to be recognized as such, the predicate expression must be
;;; written as a LET form, not a macro invocation that expands to a LET form.
;;; I think this is a feature, but am open to being persuaded otherwise.)
;;;
;;; To use these macros, you must shadow the standard definitions in your
;;; package.  This can be done by including the following option clause in
;;; your DEFPACKAGE form:
;;;
;;;    (:shadowing-import-from :new-let #:let #:cond)
;;;
;;; If for some reason you don't want to shadow these, you can access this
;;; version of LET as NLET, and this version of COND as BCOND (the "B" is
;;; for "binding"), by using the following DEFPACKAGE option instead:
;;;
;;;    (:import-from :new-let #:nlet #:bcond)
;;;
;;; Enjoy!

(defmacro let (clauses &body body)
  "A generalization of CL:LET that better supports nested bindings and multiple
values.  Syntax: (let (<clause>*) <body>).  The <clause> syntax is more general
than for CL:LET:
  <clause>  ::=   <symbol>                 ; binds to NIL
                | ( <symbol> )             ; likewise
		| <clause1>
  <clause1> ::=   ( <symbol>+ <form> )     ; binding
                | ( <clause1>+ )           ; nesting
When a clause begins with more than one variable name, they are to be bound to
successive values of the form.  The nesting of clauses indicates sequencing of
bindings; more deeply nested clauses may reference bindings of shallower clauses.
All bindings at a given depth are done in parallel.  This allows arbitrary
combinations of parallel and sequential binding.  Standard declarations at the
head of BODY are handled correctly, though nonstandard ones may not be.  If two
variables of the same name are bound at different levels, any declaration
applies to the inner one."
